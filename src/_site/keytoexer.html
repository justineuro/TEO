I washed myself in my room, and she washed herself in her room. The child was looking for its doll; I showed the child where its doll lay. She related to him her adventure.

I have a hundred apples. I have a hundred (of) apples. This town has a million of inhabitants. I bought a dozen (of) spoons, and two dozen (of) forks. One thousand years (or, a thousand of years) make a millennium.

Firstly, I return to you the money which you lent to me; secondly, I thank you for the loan; thirdly, I beg you also afterwards (on a future occasion) to lend to me when I (shall) require money.

Three is half of six, eight is four-fifths of ten. Four metres of this stuff cost nine francs, therefore two metres cost four and a-half francs. One day is a three hundred and sixty-fifth or a three hundred and sixty-sixth of a year.
</p>
<p>
Five times seven are thirty-five. For each day I receive five francs, but for to-day I have received double pay, that is, ten francs.

</p>
<center>
<b>10.</b>

<p>
Give (to) the birds water, for they want to drink. Alexander will not learn, and therefore I beat Alexander. Who has courage (dares) to ride on a lion? I was going to beat him, but he ran away from me.
</p>
<p>
Do not give your hand to a lion. Relate (tell) to my young friend a beautiful story. Tell father that I am diligent. Tell me your name. Do not write to me such long letters. Show me your new coat. Child, do not touch the looking-glass. Dear children, always be honest. Do not listen to him.
</p>
<p>
He says that I am attentive. He begs me to be attentive. Tell him not to chatter. Ask him to send me a candle. The cottage is worth your buying (worthy that you should buy it). She strongly desired that he (should) remain alive.
</p>
<p>
Let him come, and I will forgive him. Let us be gay, let us use life well, for life is not long. Let him not come alone, but come with his best friend. I already have my hat; now look for yours.

<p>
If the pupil knew his lesson well, the teacher would not punish him. If you knew who he is, you would esteem him more. They raised one hand upwards as if they were holding something. If I really were beautiful, others would try to imitate me. Oh! if I were (had) already the age of fifteen years!
</p>
<center>
<b>12.</b>
</center>
<p>
To remain with a lion is dangerous. The knife cuts well, for it is sharp. Go more quickly. He shut the door angrily. His speech flows softly and pleasantly. We made the contract not in writing, but by word of mouth. An honest man acts honestly. The pastor who died a short time ago lived long in our city. Did you not get it back? He is sick unto death. The iron rod which was in the stove (fire) is burning; hot. Paris is very gay. Early in the morning she drove to the station.
</p>
<p>
Forgive me that I stayed so long. His anger lasted long. He is to-day in an angry temper. The king soon sent again another good-hearted official. This evening we shall have a ball. Where are you? Away from here! (Get away!).
</p>
<p>
Where did he drive away to? She ran home. We went forward like furies. Everything was right (good), and we went on further. The lady glanced back. The sailors demanded to go back (required that one should go back). I hung it here, for it saved my life. I never sent here.
</p>

<b>13.</b>

<p>
My brother is not big, but he is not little, he is of medium growth. A hair is very thin. The night is so dark that we can see nothing even before our nose. This stale bread is hard as stone. Naughty children love to torment animals. He felt (himself) so miserable that he cursed the day on which he was born. We greatly despise this base man. The window was long unclosed; I closed it, but my brother immediately opened it again. A straight road is shorter than a curved. Do not be ungrateful.
</p>
<p>
The wife of my father is my mother, and the grandmother of my children. My sister is a very beautiful girl. My aunt is a very good woman. I saw your grandmother with her four granddaughters, and with my niece. I have an ox and a cow. The young widow became again a fiancée.

</p>
<!-- =============================104.png============================ -->
<p>
In the course of a few minutes I heard two shots. The firing continued for a very long time. His speech of yesterday was very fine, but too much speaking tires him. He is singing a very beautiful song. Singing is an agreeable occupation. With my hand I kept on briskly rubbing him. The rain kept on falling in rivers. Every minute she kept looking out through the window and cursing the slow motion of the train.
</p>
<p>
I leap very cleverly. I started with surprise. I used to jump all day long from place to place. When you began to speak I expected to hear something new. The diamond has a beautiful sparkle. She let the diamond flash. Two flashes of lightning passed across the dark sky.

If we need to use a preposition, and the sense does not show us what preposition to use, then we can use the general preposition “je.” But it is well to use the word “je” as seldom as possible. Instead of the word “je” we can also use the accusative without a preposition. I laugh at his simplicity (or, I laugh on account of his simplicity; or, I ridicule his simplicity). The last time I saw him with you I travelled two days and one night. I sigh for my lost happiness. From the said rule it follows that if we do not know as to any verb whether it requires the accusative case after it (that is, whether it is active) or not, we can always use the accusative. For example, we can say “obei al la patro” and “obei la patron” (instead of “obei je la patro”). But we do not use the accusative when the clearness of the sense forbids it; for example, we can say “pardoni al la malamiko” and “pardoni la malamikon,” but we must always say “pardoni al la malamiko lian kulpon.”

A father and a mother together are named parents. Peter, Anne, and Elizabeth are my brother and sisters. Mr. and Mrs. N. will come to us this evening. The engaged couple stood by the altar. I congratulated the young married pair by telegraph. The king and queen left Cordova. She married (with) her cousin, although her parents wished to marry her to another person.

My wife’s father is my father-in-law, I am his son-in-law, and my father is the father-in-law of my wife. All my wife’s relations are my relations by marriage, consequently her brother is my brother-in-law, her sister is my sister-in-law; my brother and sister are the brother-in-law and sister-in-law of my wife. The wife of my nephew and the niece of my wife are my nieces by marriage. A woman who treats the sick is a lady doctor; the wife of a doctor is a doctor’s wife. Mrs. Dr. A. visited Dr. and Mrs. P. to-day. He is not a laundryman, he is a washerwoman’s husband.

The sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of a king are princes. The Hebrews are Israelites, for they are descended from Israel. A foal is an immature horse, a chicken an immature fowl, a calf an immature ox, a fledgeling an immature bird. That beautiful land was in a very primeval state.

Steel is flexible, but iron is not flexible. Not every plant is edible. Glass is breakable and transparent. Your speech is quite incomprehensible, and your letters are always written quite illegibly. The darkness is impenetrable. He related to me a story altogether incredible. Perhaps I can (shall be able to) help you. Do you love your father? What a question! of course (that) I love him. Probably I shall not be able to come to you to-day, for I think that I myself shall have guests to-day. The table stands askew, and will probably soon fall over. He did his best (his possible).

He is a man unworthy of belief. Your action is very praiseworthy. This important day will remain for me for ever memorable. It is a coat of great worth. It is not worthy of thanks. The crew show [themselves] unworthy of their leader.

His wife is very hardworking and economical, but she is also very fond of talking and noisy. He is very irascible, and often becomes excited at the merest trifle; nevertheless he is very forgiving, he does not bear anger long, and he is not at all revengeful. He is very credulous; even the most incredible things, which the most untrustworthy people relate to him, he immediately believes. He is very cleanly, and you will not find even one speck of dust on his coat. He is an excellent boy, but very apt to believe [in] spirits.

We all came together to talk over very important business, but we could not reach any result, and we parted. Misery often unites people, and happiness often separates them. I tore up the letter, and threw its bits into every corner (all corners) of the room. After this they separated for home. The road branched in several directions.

I willingly fulfilled his desire. In bad weather one may easily take cold. He unbuttoned his overcoat. She played with her fan. Shirts, collars, cuffs, and other similar things we call linen, although they are not always made of linen.
